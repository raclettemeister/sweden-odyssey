# The Sweden Odyssey - True Story

## The Group

- **Scout Unit**: La 90ème (La Nonantième), Compagnie Scout Notre-Dame de Stockel
- **Members**: 20 boy scouts, aged 16 to 18
- **Staff**: 3 adults

## The Departure

**July 1, 2021** — The journey began in **Wezembeek-Oppem**, Belgium, where the group assembled and prepared their huge backpacks for the trip ahead.

## The Journey North (July 1-5)

The group departed Belgium by train on July 1st, 2021, with a first stop in **Cologne, Germany**. From there, they continued northward to Sweden — a grueling **3-day train journey**. There were no hotels; the group slept on the trains and in gas stations along the way. During the transit, they had many encounters with homeless people.

Upon arriving in Sweden, the group set up a **mid-camp** at the beginning of their route to gather their strength before the real trek. This was a time for:

- **Foraging for food**, including mussels
- **Testing their swimming gear** — swim suits they would need later inside the Arctic Circle

By **July 5th**, they had reached **Malmö**. One last sleep inside a train station, and the true journey was about to begin.
