## 📖 The Story

You are Julien, transforming a dying épicerie sèche (dry goods store) into the neighborhood's beloved fromagerie. Balance business growth with family life, navigate crises, and maybe—just maybe—save enough to buy the building before the deadline.

## ✨ Features

- **25 months** of real decisions based on actual events
- **Dynamic financials** with seasonal fluctuations (December rush!)
- **Work/life balance** mechanics - burnout and family relationships matter
- **Photo album** of memories unlocked through gameplay
- **Procedural jazz music** that adapts to your stress level
- **Pixel art scenes** that evolve with your choices

## 🐕 Meet Poncho

The Australian Shepherd who stole every heart. He's not optional.

## 🎯 Win Condition

Save €80,000 to buy the building before the deadline. But the real victory is the story you create along the way.
